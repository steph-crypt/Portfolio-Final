  <h2>FullStack Developer</h2>
    <p>Do not try and bend the spoon.</p>
    <p>That’s impossible. Instead… only try to realize the truth.</p>
    <p>What truth?</p>
    <p>There is no spoon.</p>
    <p>There is no spoon?</p>
    <p> Then you’ll see, that it is not the spoon that bends, it is only yourself.</p>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a Fullstack Ruby on Rails web developer with a background in linguistics and writing. Coding engages my practical love of languages and logic with the incredible potency of computational rendering. When I began coding it was as though the veil had been lifted from the mysteriously powerful object that digitization is, and I came to see that all modern technology is compiled of beautifully, masterfully, creatively braided strands of logic, engineered by human genius. Realizing this, I became obsessed with the infinite potential of coding. Coding is human magic.</p>
